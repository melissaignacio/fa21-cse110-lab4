* Question 1: The code at line 12 outputs "3". The variable 'i' is used to track the length of the 'prices' array which has a length of 3. The for loop is used to make sure to only iterate as long as 'i' has a value which is within the indices of the 'prices' array. The variable 'i' has a value of 3 at the end of the for loop becasuse the conditionn inside the loop no longer allowed it to increment. 
* Question 2: The code at line 13 outputs "150". The last iteration of the for loop updates 'discountedPrice' with calculations to 150. Once the program exits the for loop, 'discountedPrice' is printed.
* Question 3: The code at line 14 outputs "150". The last iteration of the for loop updates 'finalPrice' with calculations to 150. Once the program exits the for loop, 'finalPrice' is printed.
* Question 4: The function returns an array of discounted prices based on the discount percentage and array of original prices. It will still return the desired ouput.
* Question 5: The code outputs an error becasue the variable 'i' is defined in the for loop block and is no longer considered defined in line 12.
* Question 6: The code outputs an error becasue the variable 'discountedPrice' is defined in the for loop block and is no longer considered defined in line 13.
* Question 7: The code at line 14 outputs "150". The last iteration of the for loop updates 'finalPrice' with calculations to 150. Once the program exits the for loop, 'finalPrice' is printed. 'finalPrice' is is defined in the outside block which allows it to be defined throughtout the function.
* Question 8: The function returns an array of discounted prices based on the discount percentage and array of original prices. It will still return the desired ouput.
* Question 9: The code outputs an error becasue the variable 'i' is defined in the for loop block and is no longer considered defined in line 11.
* Question 10: The code at line 12 outputs "3". The variable 'length' is a const that was set equalt to the length of the array prices which is 3.
* Question 11: The function returns an array of discounted prices based on the discount percentage and array of original prices. It will still return the desired ouput.
* Question 12: 
    * (A) student.name 
    * (B) student["Grad Year"] 
    * (C) student.greeting() 
    * (D) student["Favorite Teacher"].name 
    * (E) student.courseLoad[0]
